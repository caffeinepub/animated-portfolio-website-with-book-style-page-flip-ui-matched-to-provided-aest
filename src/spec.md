# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new hackathon entry to the About Me page’s Experience hackathons list.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/features/portfolio/pages/AboutPage.tsx` by adding a 5th item to the `hackathons` array under “Quant Insider”: “Market Making Challenge organized by Quant Insider and Fintech Club, IIT ISM Dhanbad”.
- Keep the existing rendering style and list formatting consistent with the other hackathon entries.

**User-visible outcome:** The About Me page (Experience section) shows the new Quant Insider hackathon entry in the Hackathons list, with the same styling as existing items.
